Problem Setting: Fetal health monitoring is a critical aspect of prenatal care, offering essential insights for healthcare practitioners to ensure optimal outcomes during pregnancy. Accurate assessment of fetal well-being is paramount, as deviations from normal conditions can indicate potential risks and complications. Cardiotocography (CTG) serves as a fundamental tool in this regard, providing a real-time evaluation of fetal heart rate and uterine contractions. By offering continuous monitoring, CTG enables practitioners to detect early signs of fetal distress, guiding timely interventions and facilitating informed decision-making. The comprehensive understanding of fetal health through CTG interpretation enhances the ability of healthcare professionals to safeguard the well-being of both the mother and the unborn child throughout the pregnancy journey.

Problem Definition: This project aims to develop a robust fetal health classification system using machine learning algorithms in Python. Focused on Cardiotocography (CTG), a vital tool in monitoring fetal heart rate and uterine contractions during pregnancy, the objective is to create a predictive model. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the model will classify CTG outcomes, aiding in the early detection of fetal distress and providing valuable insights for healthcare practitioners. The ultimate goal is to contribute to improved fetal well-being by offering an efficient and accurate classification system for CTG results, thereby assisting in timely interventions and risk assessment during pregnancy.
